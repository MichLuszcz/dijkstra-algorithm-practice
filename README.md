This is the implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm, which takes in the graph as a text file (where X represents the beginning and goal, numbers the cost of moving through a given cell, and blank spaces walls).

Prints out the optimal path.

Algorithm based on one I already implemented for a navigation app in a different group project (typescript file).
usage example:
```shell
python main.py graf1.txt
```

```shell
python main.py grafcustom1.txt
```

```shell
python main.py grafcustom2.txt
```
